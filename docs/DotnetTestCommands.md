Platform Options:
  --debug                         Allows to pause execution in order to attach to the process for debug purposes.
  --diagnostic                    Enable the diagnostic logging. The default log level is 'Trace'.
                                  The file will be written in the output directory with the name log_[yyMMddHHmmssfff].diag
  --diagnostic-file-prefix        Prefix for the log file name that will replace '[log]_.'
  --diagnostic-synchronous-write  Force the built-in file logger to write the log synchronously.
                                  Useful for scenario where you don't want to lose any log (i.e. in case of crash).
                                  Note that this is slowing down the test execution.
  --diagnostic-verbosity          Define the level of the verbosity for the --diagnostic.
                                  The available values are 'Trace', 'Debug', 'Information', 'Warning', 'Error', and 'Critical'.
  --exit-on-process-exit          Exit the test process if dependent process exits. PID must be provided.
  --filter-uid                    Provides a list of test node UIDs to filter by.
  --help                          Show the command line help.
  --ignore-exit-code              Do not report non successful exit value for specific exit codes
                                  (e.g. '--ignore-exit-code 8;9' ignore exit code 8 and 9 and will return 0 in these case)
  --info                          Display .NET test application information.
  --timeout                       A global test execution timeout.
